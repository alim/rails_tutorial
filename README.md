This repository is for demonstrating a simple Ruby on Rails application. The application
is a simple asset registration system. The tutorial will cover the following:

* Application generation
* Updates to the views using Foundation Zurb
* Creating automated testcases for Models/Controllers/Features

# Tutorial Steps

The steps for each tutorial will be documented in the Wiki for this repository and
the results of each tutorial step will be captured in a separate Github branch
(e.g. step_1_scaffold).
